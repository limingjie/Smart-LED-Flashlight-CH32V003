## Components

### MCU - CH32V003

The CH32V003 is a low-cost, high-performance 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller from WCH. It features a compact design, low power consumption, and a rich set of peripherals, making it ideal for embedded applications and cost-sensitive projects. The CH32V003 supports various interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, and PWM, and is well-suited for controlling LED drivers and other hardware components.

#### Clock Selection

With a `1.5MHz` clock (`1/16` of the internal `24MHz` high-speed clock), the CH32V003 draws around `1.53mA` (the power LED draws around `1.35mA`). With clocks lower than `1.5MHz`, CH32V003 does not seem to work properly with ADC enabled and may brick the chip. If this happens, try the unbrick command (`minichlink -u`) or flash a firmware with a higher clock; note that it may require more than 10 attempts. The chip is quite robust, but recovering it may require patience!

#### Battery Monitoring

When using a lithium battery as the power supply, and considering the cutoff voltages of the CH32V003 and SGM3732, the lockout voltage is set at `3.0V` if detected 3 times.

- CH32V003: `2.8V`-`5.5V` (With ADC).
- SGM3732: `2.7V`-`5.5V`.

Since the power supply can drop below `3.3V`, directly using `3.3V` as the ADC reference would lead to inaccurate results. Fortunately, the CH32V003 provides an internal voltage reference (`1.2V` on analog channel 8), which allows for accurate ADC measurements with an error within `±1%`.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{V}_\text{Reference} &= \text{V}_\text{DD} \times \frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Reference}}}{1023}
\Longrightarrow \text{V}_\text{DD} = \frac{\text{V}_\text{Reference}}{\frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Reference}}}{1023}} \\
\text{V}_\text{Battery} &= \text{V}_\text{DD} \times \frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Battery}}}{1023} \\
&= \frac{\text{V}_\text{Reference}}{\frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Reference}}}{1023}} \times \frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Battery}}}{1023} \\
&= \text{V}_\text{Reference} \times \frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Battery}}}{\text{ADC}_\text{Reference}}\\
&=  1.2\,\text{V} \times \frac{\text{ADC}_{\text{Battery}}}{\text{ADC}_\text{Reference}}
\end{align}
$$

### LED Driver - SGM3732

The [SGM3732](https://www.sg-micro.com/product/SGM3732) is a high-efficiency constant current LED driver with a 1.1MHz PWM boost converter, optimized for compact designs using small components. It can drive up to 10 LEDs in series (up to 38V output) or deliver up to 260mA with 3 LEDs per string, while maintaining high conversion efficiency. LED current is programmable via a digital PWM dimming interface (2kHz–60kHz). The device features very low shutdown current and includes protections such as over-voltage, cycle-by-cycle input current limit, and thermal shutdown. The SGM3732 is available in a TSOT-23-6 package and operates from -40℃ to +85℃.

### Soft Latching Power Circuit

Refer to the [CH32V003 Soft Latching Power Circuits](https://github.com/limingjie/CH32V003-Soft-Latching-Power-Circuits) project.

### LDO - ME6211

The CH32V003 operates from `2.7V` to `5.5V`, but shows noticeable current fluctuations when powered directly from USB. Using an LDO stabilizes the MCU’s power supply and reduces current consumption by a few milliamps.

When the input voltage drops under `3.3V`, LDO stops regulate, the output voltage is $\text{V}_\text{In} - \text{V}_\text{Dropout}$. The dropout voltage is `~2.6mV` ($\text{V}_\text{In}$ = `~3.3V`) to `5mV` ($\text{V}_\text{In}$ = `2.85V`) when the power consumption is `~3mA`.

## Minimized ch32fun Library

- **`ch32fun.mk`** - Some modifications to accommodate library and tool paths.
  - The `LDFLAGS` path change is for locating the `ch32fun/libgcc.a`.

    ```diff
    <     LDFLAGS+=-L$(CH32FUN)/../misc -lgcc
    ---
    >     LDFLAGS+=-L$(CH32FUN) -lgcc
    ```

    - Otherwise, the compiler would use the default libgcc and throw an incompatible linking error:

      ```text
      .../riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld:
      .../riscv-gnu-toolchain/main/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-elf/15.1.0/libgcc.a(div.o):
      ABI is incompatible with that of the selected emulation:
      target emulation `elf64-littleriscv' does not match `elf32-littleriscv'
      ```

  - The other two changes are for `minichlink`:

    ```diff
    33c33
    < MINICHLINK?=$(CH32FUN)/../minichlink
    ---
    > MINICHLINK?=$(CH32FUN)
    51c51
    <     LDFLAGS+=-L$(CH32FUN)/../misc -lgcc
    ---
    >     LDFLAGS+=-L$(CH32FUN) -lgcc
    350c350
    <     make -C $(MINICHLINK) all
    ---
    >     # make -C $(MINICHLINK) all
    ```

- **`ch32fun.c`**
  - Changed line `1728` for `6MHz` HCLK, resulting in lower power consumption (<`2.6mA`).

    ```c
    1720: #elif defined(FUNCONF_USE_HSI) && FUNCONF_USE_HSI
    1721: #if defined(CH32V30x) || defined(CH32V20x) || defined(CH32V10x)
    1722:     EXTEN->EXTEN_CTR |= EXTEN_PLL_HSI_PRE;
    1723: #endif
    1724: #if defined(FUNCONF_USE_PLL) && FUNCONF_USE_PLL
    1725:     RCC->CFGR0 = BASE_CFGR0;
    1726:     RCC->CTLR  = BASE_CTLR | RCC_HSION | RCC_PLLON; // Use HSI, enable PLL.
    1727: #else
    1728:     RCC->CFGR0 = RCC_HPRE_DIV4;                    // HCLK = SYSCLK / 4
    1729:     RCC->CTLR  = BASE_CTLR | RCC_HSION;             // Use HSI only.
    1730: #endif
    ```

  - Set ADC sampling time to `241` cycles for better accuracy.

    ```c
    1808: // set sampling time for all channels to 0b111 (241 cycles).
    1809: ADC1->SAMPTR2 = (ADC_SMP0<<(3*0)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*1)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*2)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*3)) | (ADC_SMP0<<  (3*4)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*5)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*6)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*7)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*8)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*9));
    1810: ADC1->SAMPTR1 = (ADC_SMP0<<(3*0)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*1)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*2)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*3)) | (ADC_SMP0<<  (3*4)) | (ADC_SMP0<<(3*5));
    ```
